# Money-Back Guarantee System

## Overview

SkillSwap DAO provides a **7-Day Money-Back Guarantee** to ensure customer satisfaction and build trust in our decentralized skill exchange platform. This system is built directly into our smart contracts, making it transparent, secure, and automated.

## How It Works

### 1. **Escrow Protection**
- All payments are held in a smart contract escrow
- Funds are locked until service completion and approval
- No funds can be accessed without proper authorization

### 2. **7-Day Dispute Window**
- After service completion, there's a 7-day window to raise disputes
- During this period, payment remains in escrow
- Users can request a full refund if unsatisfied

### 3. **Dispute Resolution Process**
- Users can raise disputes through the platform interface
- Our team reviews disputes within 24-48 hours
- Resolution can result in full refund or payment release

### 4. **Auto-Release Protection**
- If no dispute is raised within 7 days, payment auto-releases to provider
- This prevents indefinite holding of funds
- Ensures providers receive payment for completed work

## Smart Contract Implementation

### Key Features Added:

```solidity
// Dispute-related fields in ServiceRequest struct
bool disputed;
uint256 disputeTime;
uint256 autoReleaseTime; // 7 days after completion

// Constants
uint256 public constant DISPUTE_WINDOW = 7 days;
uint256 public constant AUTO_RELEASE_WINDOW = 7 days;
```

### Core Functions:

1. **`raiseDispute(uint256 requestId)`**
   - Allows requesters to initiate disputes
   - Only available within 7-day window
   - Requires service completion but no payment release

2. **`resolveDispute(uint256 requestId, bool refundToRequester)`**
   - Platform owner can resolve disputes
   - Can refund to requester or pay to provider
   - Handles both ETH and ERC-20 tokens

3. **`autoReleasePayment(uint256 requestId)`**
   - Automatically releases payment after dispute window
   - Prevents indefinite fund holding
   - Ensures provider compensation for completed work

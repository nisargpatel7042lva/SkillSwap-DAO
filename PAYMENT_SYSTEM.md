## API Endpoints

### Payment Service Methods
```typescript
// Create payment transaction
PaymentService.createPaymentTransaction(
  bookingId: string,
  txHash: string,
  fromAddress: string,
  toAddress: string,
  amount: string,
  tokenAddress: string
)

// Update transaction status
PaymentService.updateTransactionStatus(
  txHash: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'failed',
  blockNumber?: number,
  gasUsed?: string,
  gasPrice?: string
)

// Get user payment stats

```

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions
```solidity
// Request a service (creates escrow)
function requestService(uint256 skillId, string memory requirements) 
    external payable nonReentrant

// Provider accepts request
function acceptRequest(uint256 requestId) external

// Provider marks service complete
function completeService(uint256 requestId) external

// Requester releases payment
function releasePayment(uint256 requestId) external nonReentrant

// Rate the service
function rateService(uint256 requestId, uint8 rating) external
```

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Only authorized parties can perform actions
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated
- **Event Logging**: All actions are logged for transparency

- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## Usage Examples

### Basic Payment Flow
```typescript
// 1. User selects service and enters requirements
const requirements = "I need a React component built";

// 2. Payment processor handles the flow
<PaymentProcessor
  skillId="123"
  skillPrice="1000000000000000000" // 1 ETH in wei
  skillTitle="React Development"
  requirements={requirements}
  onPaymentSuccess={handleSuccess}
  onPaymentError={handleError}
/>

// 3. Payment is processed and escrow created
// 4. Service is completed and payment released
```

### Payment History
```typescript
// Display payment history
<PaymentHistory />

// Get payment statistics
const stats = await PaymentService.getUserPaymentStats(userAddress);
console.log(`Total spent: ${stats.totalSpent} ETH`);
```

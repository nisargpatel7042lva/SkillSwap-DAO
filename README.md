   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase and Ethereum config.

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Deploy contracts (optional):**

## Smart Contract

- **SkillExchange.sol**  
  Handles skill listing, booking, escrow, and payment release.
- **Deployed on:** Sepolia Testnet  
- **ABI and address:** See `/src/lib/SkillExchangeABI.json` and `/src/lib/SkillExchange.ts`

## Challenges & Learnings

- **TypeScript & UI Integration:**  
  Integrating custom UI components with TypeScript required careful type management and sometimes custom type extensions.
- **Web3 UX:**  
  Ensuring seamless wallet connect and contract interaction meant resolving version mismatches and peer dependency issues.
- **State Persistence:**  
  Making sure user data persisted and prefilled correctly for returning users required robust error handling and Supabase schema design.
- **Demo-Ready Experience:**  
  Building a demo that clearly shows the escrow/booking flow required extra UI work, including explainer cards and a mock project management section.
